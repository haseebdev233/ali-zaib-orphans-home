# TODO: Update Gallery Page with Sections

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Define SECTIONS array in Gallery.jsx with folder-based sections (Birthdays of Orphans, Events, Life at Ali Zaib Orphan Home) and their media items.
- [ ] Update the render logic in Gallery.jsx to loop over sections, displaying section titles and grids of media cards.
- [ ] Ensure media types are correctly set (image for .jpeg, video for .mp4) and paths are '/assets/Gallary/FolderName/file.ext'.
- [ ] Test the gallery page to verify sections display correctly and media loads properly.
- [ ] If issues arise, adjust alt texts or styling as needed.
